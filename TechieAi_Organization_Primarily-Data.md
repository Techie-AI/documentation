# TechieAi Organization

Welcome to the TechieAi organization! We are a team of passionate developers working together to build innovative AI-driven applications. Our current focus is on creating a chatbot that assists users in building PCs by providing compatibility checks and recommendations for hardware components. Our mission is to simplify the process of building a custom PC by leveraging AI technology to deliver accurate and user-friendly guidance.

## Projects

### 1. PC Build Chatbot

**Description:**  
A Flutter-based application that integrates with the Gemini API to provide users with detailed guidance on PC builds. The chatbot helps users determine the compatibility of various hardware components, such as CPUs, RAM, SSDs, and motherboards. Users can ask questions about the specifications they need, and the chatbot will suggest compatible parts and configurations that meet their requirements. This ensures that users can make informed decisions when selecting components, avoiding compatibility issues and optimizing performance.

**Features:**
- **Compatibility Checks:** The chatbot can verify if the selected components are compatible with each other, reducing the risk of hardware conflicts.
- **Guided Recommendations:** Based on user inputs like budget, performance needs, and specific use cases, the chatbot provides tailored hardware recommendations.
- **Real-time Responses:** Leveraging the power of the Gemini API, the chatbot delivers quick and accurate responses to user queries.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The application features an intuitive chat interface, making it easy for users to interact with the chatbot and get the information they need.
- **Expandable Database:** While we currently have detailed data on CPUs, we are continuously expanding our database to include more components such as GPUs, RAM, SSDs, and motherboards.
